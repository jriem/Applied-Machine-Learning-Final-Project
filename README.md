# Applied-Machine-Learning-Final-Project
Plan to build a classifier using Spotify data on music people like and the music's attributes 
to predict new songs they will like and use those to construct a "Discover Weekly" playlist. 

Data provided by Spotify for experimentation. Project introduction link: https://labs.spotify.com/2018/05/30/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/
